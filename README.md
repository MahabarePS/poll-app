# Djang-venture

## Description

- What was your motivation?
  - I developed Django apps throughout my master's and work, but they were goal-specific with crash courses. While doing so, I enjoyed it and made a note to myself to experiment with it in different scripts, databases, VPSs, and so on.
  
- Why did you build this project?
  -I wanted to encapsulate framework-specific projects under the framework umbrella. There are two main reasons I did what I did:
    - Project Title can give you what it does in an abstract, forcing users to browse each repository.
    - I can validate the solutions with the respective framework claims.
